    cd frontend  
    npm install  
    cd ..  
    ```  

4. Set up your database:
    - Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., use the `createdb` command or a GUI tool like pgAdmin):
        ```bash
        createdb eplatform
        ```
    - Update database settings in `backend/django/settings.py`:
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': 'eplatform',
                'USER': 'your_database_user',
                'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': '5432',
            }
        }
        ```  

5. Apply migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations  
    python manage.py migrate  
    ```  

6. Create a superuser account:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser  
    ```  

7. Start the development servers:
    - **Backend:**
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver  
        ```
    - **Frontend:**  
        Open a new terminal window and run:
        ```bash
        cd frontend  
        npm start  
        ```  

8. Access your platform:  
    Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) (or the port specified by your backend server).
