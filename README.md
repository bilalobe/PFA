    cd frontend  
    npm install  
    cd ..  
    ```  

4. Set up your database:
    - Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., use the `createdb` command or a GUI tool like pgAdmin):
        ```bash
        createdb eplatform
        ```
    - Update database settings in `backend/django/settings.py`:
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': 'eplatform',
                'USER': 'your_database_user',
                'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': '5432',
            }
